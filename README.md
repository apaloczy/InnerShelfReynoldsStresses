This repository contains codes and processed datasets for a manuscript entitled **"Subtidal to supertidal variability of Reynolds stresses in a mid-latitude stratified inner-shelf"**, by A. Palóczy, J. A. MacKinnon and A. F. Waterhouse, [published on the Journal of Physical Oceanography](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/aop/JPO-D-20-0140.1/JPO-D-20-0140.1.xml). This [Jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/apaloczy/InnerShelfReynoldsStresses/blob/master/index.ipynb) provides an overview of the contents.

The directory **plot_figs/** contains the Python codes used to produce the figures in the manuscript (Figures 1-14). The codes depend on the data files in the **data_reproduce_figs/** directory. Some of these are too large to be included in this repository, but are available for download from the links listed on the accompanying README files.

## Abstract
We describe the spatio-temporal variability and vertical structure of turbulent Reynolds Stresses (RSs) in a stratified inner-shelf with an energetic internal wave climate. The RSs are estimated from direct measurements of velocity variance derived from bottom-mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers. We link the RSs to different physical processes, namely internal bores, mid-water shear instabilities within vertical shear events related to wind-driven subtidal along-shelf currents; and non-turbulent stresses related to incoming Nonlinear Internal Wave (NLIW) trains. The typical RS magnitudes are O(0.01 Pa) for background conditions, with diurnal pulses of O(0.1-1 Pa), and O(1 Pa) for the NLIW stresses. A NLIW train is observed to produce a depth-averaged vertical stress divergence sufficient to accelerate water 20 cm/s in 1 hour, suggesting NLIWs may also be important contributors to the depth-averaged momentum budget. The subtidal stresses show significant periodic variability and are O(0.1 Pa). Conditionally-averaged velocity and RS profiles for northward/southward flow provide evidence for down-gradient turbulent momentum fluxes, but also indicate departures from this expected regime. Estimates of the terms in the depth-averaged momentum equation suggest that the vertical divergence of the RSs are important terms in both the cross-shelf and along-shelf directions, with geostrophy also present at leading-order in the cross-shelf momentum balance. Among other conclusions, the results highlight that internal bores and shoaling NLIWs may also be important dynamical players in other inner-shelves with energetic internal waves.
